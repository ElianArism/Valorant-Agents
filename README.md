# Valorant Agents

This the ultimate Valorant Glosary about all the agents that are currently on the game.

The most important thing for me in this proyect was the design. I tried to make colorful pages based on the main palette of each character.

Also, I wanted to try the new features that angular v16 had, such as:

- New form to inject services
- Retrieve route params using the @Input() directive
- Required @Input()
- Signals

I didn't implement lazy loading in the app routes because the proyect has just a few components and three pages.

## Tech Stack
